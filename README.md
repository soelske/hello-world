# hello-world
My first try

Hello everybody, 

My name is Bart and my first real job was working as a service engineer. This required me a lot of time on the road, much hours in traffic jams and long days. On occasion I was alowed to work in R&D and I loved programming. So I decided for myself I wanted to be a software Developer. 

That is why i started doing some side projects in my spare time and I place them on GitHub 

Bye!
